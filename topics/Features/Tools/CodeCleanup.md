If you want to fix an error at a particular location in code, you can create a Quick-Fix. But what if you need to fix that same error in all locations in a file, the whole project, or even the whole solution? This is there the concept of _Code Cleanup_ comes into play.

The first thing to note about Code Cleanup is that it does _not_ use highlightings and quick-fixes. Why not? Highlightings are not used because there might be issues that only Code Cleanup applies to. As for Quick-Fixes themselves, it pays to remember that there might be more than one quick-fix per highlighting, so there’s no real certainty that you’d be using the right one.

## Profiles and Descriptors

Take a look at the following screenshot:

![Code cleanup dialog showing available profiles](code_cleanup_dialog.png)

As you can see, code cleanup consists of several _profiles_. A profile is simply a set of settings: in one profile, for example, the _Arrange ‘this’ qualifier_ option might be set to _Yes_, in another, to _No_. The two profiles you see in the above screenshot - _Full Cleanup_ and _Reformat Code_ - are default profiles. They cannot be deleted, and internally, the R# API has enumerations for each of these. Of course, users can also have their own profiles created in the _Edit Profiles_ dialog.

Each of the settings listed under the profile details is provided using a _descriptor_. The descriptor is a class that:

* Inherits from one of the `CodeCleanupOptionDescriptor` classes. For example, to create a boolean setting, you would inherit from `CodeCleanupBoolOptionDescriptor`.
* Is decorated with the `DefaultValue` attribute, specifying its default value. Note however that these default values are effectively overridden when it comes to the built-in code cleanup profiles.
* Is decorated with the `DisplayName` attribute, which contains the string displayed in the UI.
* Is decorated with the `Category` attribute, indicating the option’s applicability. A set of ready-made categories can be found as static members of the `CodeCleanupOptionsDescrpitor` class.

Here’s what a typical option descriptor looks like:

```csharp
[DefaultValue(false)]
[DisplayName("Replace Math.Pow() integer calls")]
[Category(CSharpCategory)]
private class Descriptor : CodeCleanupBoolOptionDescriptor
{
  public Descriptor() : base("ReplaceMathPowIntegerCalls")
  {
  }
}
```

Option descriptors are typically stored in and returned from the code cleanup module that uses them.

## Code Cleanup Module

The code cleanup module is a component that provides code cleanup functionality. To count as a code cleanup module, all a class has to do is implement the `ICodeCleanupModule` interface and be decorated with the `CodeCleanupModule` attribute.

The module is customizable with the descriptors we’ve just seen, and has a `Descriptors` member to yield all the descriptors that are available to it. For example:

```csharp
private static readonly Descriptor descriptor = new Descriptor();

public ICollection<CodeCleanupOptionDescriptor> Descriptors
{
  get { return new[] {descriptor}; }
}
```

In order to figure out whether the module is applicable or not, we must implement the `IsAvailable()` method:

```csharp
public bool IsAvailable(IPsiSourceFile sourceFile)
{
  return sourceFile.GetPsiFile<CSharpLanguage>() != null;
}
```

The above simply checks that the file is a C# file.

Also, as mentioned previously, we must provide default values for the module’s descriptors for the two built-in code cleanup templates. This is done in the `SetDefaultSetting()` method:

```csharp
public void SetDefaultSetting(CodeCleanupProfile profile, CodeCleanup.DefaultProfileType profileType)
{
  switch (profileType)
  {
    case CodeCleanup.DefaultProfileType.FULL:
      profile.SetSetting(descriptor, true);
      break;
    default:
      profile.SetSetting(descriptor, false);
      break;
  }
}
```

Finally, most of the modifications happen in the `Process()` method. This is the method where code is ‘cleaned up’, i.e. modified. Unlike some of the utility base classes (e.g., `BulbItemImpl`), the implemented interface provides no plumbing for transacted behavior, which means that to perform modifications on the document you’ll need to write code similar to the following:

```csharp
file.GetPsiServices().PsiManager.DoTransaction(() =>
{
  using (shellLocks.UsingWriteLock())
  {
    // your changes here
  }
}, "Code cleanup");
```
