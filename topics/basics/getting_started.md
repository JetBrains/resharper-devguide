This documentation section will help you get started with developing ReSharper Platform plugins.
You can use either [JetBrains Rider](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/download) or [Microsoft Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/) (with or without [ReSharper](https://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/download/)) as your IDE (it is highly recommended to use the latest available version).
Please refer to the [Rider Web Help](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/rider) or [ReSharper Web Help](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/resharper) to become more familiar with the products.
