[//]: # (title: Creating Node Types)

A custom language requires many `NodeType` classes and instances to be created. After all, every distinct type of node in a PSI tree needs a distinct `NodeType` instance. While it is possible to create these classes and instances by hand, it is more manageable to use tooling to generate the code.

The SDK provides the `TokenGenerator` tool to convert an XML file listing tokens and keywords into `TokenNodeType` classes and static singleton instances. The `PsiGen` tool is used to create a parser from a `.psi` file, but it also creates `ITreeNode` classes and `CompositeNodeType` classes and instances.

The output of the lexer is a stream of singleton instances of `TokenNodeType` derived classes. The parser doesn't need to know the actual class of the token node type, it only needs to compare it against a known singleton value, and call a known method - `TokenNodeType.Create`. The same is true for interior tree nodes - the class of the `CompositeNodeType` is irrelevant, instead, the known singleton value is used to call `CompositeNodeType.Create` to create the interior tree node.

As such, the usual structure when creating node types is to create them as private nested classes inside a "token type" or "element type" class, and create public static fields that expose the singleton instance. 

## Creating token node types

For example, the C# language defines the `CSharpTokenType` class. This is not to be confused with the `CSharpTokenNodeType`, which is the class derived from `TokenNodeType`, and acts as the base class for all C# token node types. Instead, the `CSharpTokenType` class contains a number of private class definitions - `CSharpTokenNodeType`, `WhitespaceNodeType`, `NewLineNodeType` and so on. It also contains public static fields of type `TokenNodeType`, such as `WHITE_SPACE`, `NEW_LINE`, `END_OF_LINE_COMMENT` and so on (the capitals betray the Java heritage, and ReSharper's lineage from IntelliJ).

```csharp
public static partial class CSharpTokenType
{
  private abstract class CSharpTokenNodeType : TokenNodeType
  {
    // ...
  }

  private sealed class GenericNodeType : CSharpTokenNodeType
  {
    // ...
  }

  private sealed class WhitespaceNodeType : CSharpTokenNodeType
  {
    // ...
  }

  private sealed class NewLineNodeType : CSharpTokenNodeType
  {
    // ...
  }

  public static readonly TokenNodeType WHITE_SPACE = new WhitespaceNodeType(LAST_GENERATED_TOKEN_TYPE_INDEX + 1);
  public static readonly TokenNodeType NEW_LINE = new NewLineNodeType(LAST_GENERATED_TOKEN_TYPE_INDEX + 2);
  public static readonly TokenNodeType END_OF_LINE_COMMENT = new EndOfLineCommentNodeType(LAST_GENERATED_TOKEN_TYPE_INDEX + 3);

  public static readonly TokenNodeType INTEGER_LITERAL = new GenericTokenNodeType("INTEGER_LITERAL", LAST_GENERATED_TOKEN_TYPE_INDEX + 6, "000");
  public static readonly TokenNodeType FLOAT_LITERAL = new GenericTokenNodeType("FLOAT_LITERAL", LAST_GENERATED_TOKEN_TYPE_INDEX + 7, "0.0");
  public static readonly TokenNodeType CHARACTER_LITERAL = new GenericTokenNodeType("CHARACTER_LITERAL", LAST_GENERATED_TOKEN_TYPE_INDEX + 8, "'C'");
}
```

The unique index for the node type is passed into the constructor, and is based on the `LAST_GENERATED_TOKEN_TYPE_INDEX` value, which in turn is generated by the `TokenGenerator` SDK tool.

The whitespace, new line and comment token node types are specific classes, and only need the index, while the integer, float and character literal token node types are instances of `GenericTokenNodeType`, and require a name, index and representation.

Not shown in the sample above is that the node type classes all implement the `Create` method, and return an instance of an `ITreeNode`, or more specifically, a class that derives from `LeafElementBase`. This is covered in more detail in the section on creating tree nodes.

Also note that the `CSharpTokenType` class is a `partial` class. This allows other token node types and instances to be created in other files. Typically, a custom language will define the base token node types by hand - `CSharpTokenNodeType`, `WhitespaceTokenNodeType`, `IdentifierTokenNodeType` and also `FixedTokenNodeType`, `KeywordTokenNodeType` and `GenericTokenNodeType`. However, fixed(-length) tokens and keywords are usually generated by `TokenGenerator`.

## Generating token node types

The `TokenGenerator` SDK tool takes an input XML file and creates a C# file that contains the "token type" class, declared as `partial`, and defines classes and instances for each of the fixed tokens and keywords in the file. It will also create the `LAST_GENERATED_TOKEN_TYPE_INDEX` value seen above). It also generates the `ITreeNode` classes for each token.

The format of the XML file is very simple. For example, consider tokens for a language called "Foo". The XML file is called `tokens.xml` or `FooTokenType.Tokens.xml` or something similar:

```xml
<Tokens TokenTypeNamespace="MyCompany.MyProduct.Psi.Foo.Parsing"
        TokenTypeClass="FooTokenType"
        BaseTokenNodeTypeIndex="8000"
        KeywordNodeType="KeywordTokenNodeType"
        KeywordTokenElement="FixedTokenElement"
        TokenNodeType="FixedTokenNodeType"
        TokenTokenElement="FixedTokenElement"
        Dynamic="false">

  <Keyword name="RETURN_KEYWORD" representation="return" />
  <Keyword name="NAMESPACE_KEYWORD" representation="namespace" />
  <!-- ... -->

  <Token name="LPARENTH" representation="(" />
  <Token name="RPARENTH" representation=")" />
  <!-- ... -->
</Token>
```

The attributes to the root `Tokens` element are as follows:

* `TokenTypeNamespace` - the namespace of the "token type" class that will be generated. Should match the manually written "token type" class.
* `TokenTypeClass` - the name of the "token type" class that will hold private token node type class definitions.
* `BaseTokenNodeTypeIndex` - the initial value used for the index of each token node type. This value needs to be unique across languages, but multiple languages can reuse the same value. However, if there is any chance of token node types being reused across languages (e.g. with languages that extend other languages, such as TypeScript and JavaScript), then care should be taken that these numbers do not clash. If this value isn't specified, the default value is 1000.
* `KeywordNodeType` - the base class to use when generating keyword token node types.
* `KeywordTokenElement` - the base class used when generating the `ITreeNode` for this node type, which is returned from the token node type's `Create` method. See the section on creating tree nodes for more details. Typically, this is a manually created class called `FixedTokenElement` (there is no need for a `KeywordTokenElement`).
* `TokenNodeType` - the base class to use when generating a fixed token, such as an operator or other punctuation. Typically a manually created class called `FixedTokenNodeType`.
* `TokenTokenElement` - the base class used when generating the `ITreeNode` for this node type, which is returned from the token node type's `Create` method. See the section on creating tree nodes for more details. Typically, this is a manually created class called `FixedTokenElement`.
* `Dynamic` - defaults to `false`. If `true`, the `ITreeNode` that is created is passed the text of the token, such as an identifier's name. This isn't usually needed, as the tokens (operators, punctuation and keywords) are usually fixed.

The child elements of `Tokens` are either `Token` or `Keyword`. A `Token` element will generate a class that derives from `FixedTokenNodeType`, while `Keyword` will generate a class that derives from `KeywordTokenNodeType` (or whatever names were specified in the XML file). Both elements take the same attributes:

* `name` - the name of the token or keyword node type. This is typically specified in all-caps, such as `ABSTRACT_KEYWORD`, and normalised, by converting to camel case, such as `AbstractKeyword`. The all-caps version is used as the name of the singleton instance.
* `title` - if specified, is used as the identifier passed to the base class, and used to construct the name of the node type and token element classes. If not specified, then the normalised `name` is used instead.
* `representation` - the value passed to `TokenNodeType.TokenRepresentation`.
* `filtered` - defaults to `false`. If `true`, adds an implementation of `TokenNodeType.IsFiltered`, which returns `true`. This is usually only used by whitespace and comments, which tend to have their own hand written token node type implementation. However, it can be used by any insignificant syntax tokens.

## Using the TokenGenerator

In order to invoke the `TokenGenerator` tool on the XML file, the XML file's Build Action needs to be specified in Visual Studio's Properties pane. Select the XML file, open the Properties pane, and set the Build Action to `TokenGenerator`.

The ReSharper SDK sets up the build process to run the `TokenGenerator` during a compile. However, it requires the output file to be added to the MSBuild file. Open the `.csproj` and find the line for the `tokens.xml` file, and change it to something like:

```xml
<ItemGroup>
  <TokenGenerator Include="src\...\FooTokenType.xml">
    <OutputFile>src\...\FooTokenType.generated.cs</OutputFile>
  </TokenGenerator>
</ItemGroup>
```

Where the path in `OutputFile` is the same as the path in the `Include` statement.

If the `OutputFile` isn't specified, the tokens aren't generated, and the build will fail. If the token node types are generated correctly, they are automatically added into the list of files to be compiled, and the build will be successful. However, it doesn't get added to the project, which can lead to unresolved errors as ReSharper won't be able to find the class definitions. It is recommended to add the generated file to the project. It can be safely excluded from source control, should you wish - the file will be rebuilt at the next compile.

## Creating composite node types

The same basic pattern is followed for composite node types - create an owning type, usually called `ElementType`, and create private nested classes that derive from `CompositeNodeType`. Finally, create a public static field of type `CompositeNodeType` that exposes the singleton instance.

There are a couple of minor differences to how token node types are created. Typically, the composite node types are created by the `psiGen` parser generator SDK tool, and this creates a class called `ElementType` rather than including the language name, such as `CSharpTokenType`.

Also, the names of the composite node type classes are created from the rules in the `.psi` grammar, by converting "CamelCase" to "SHOUTING_SNAKE_CASE", and adding `_INTERNAL`. So a rule such as `colorProfileBlock` creates a private nested composite node class called `COLOR_PROFILE_BLOCK_INTERNAL`, which is then exposed as a public static field instance called `COLOR_PROFILE_BLOCK`.

This `psiGen` tool is described in more detail in the section on parsing.
