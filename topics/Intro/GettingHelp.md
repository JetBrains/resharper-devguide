## Problems with the guide

If you're having problems with the guide itself, such as missing, incorrect or confusing content, please [raise an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/JetBrains/resharper-devguide/issues). If the problem is easily solved, why not submit a Pull Request?

If you just want to share feedback on the guide, again, raise an issue, even if it's for a discussion, ideas on improvements or suggestions.

Please don't use GitHub issues for support requests. Instead, please use one of the methods below.

## Problems with code - support issues

For problems related to code, rather than the content of the guide, you have several options:

* **Email support** - you can also email JetBrains directly, either at `support@jetbrains.com` or `resharper-plugins@jetbrains.com`, although we would prefer to use the Google Group, if possible, as the answers can be shared with the community.
* **StackOverflow** - we monitor the [`resharper`](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/resharper), [`resharper-plugins`](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/resharper-plugins) and [`resharper-sdk`](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/resharper-sdk) tags on [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com), so you can ask questions about extending the ReSharper Platform on StackOverflow. Make sure to tag the question, or it won't get seen!

Of course, all issues will be used to try and improve this guide.
