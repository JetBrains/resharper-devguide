[//]: # (title: Getting Help)

## Problems with the guide

If you’re having problems with the guide itself, such as missing, incorrect, or confusing content, please [raise an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/JetBrains/resharper-devguide/issues).
If the problem is easily solved, you can also submit a [Pull Request](resharper-devguide_CONTRIBUTING.md).

If you want to report (smaller) issues for a _specific_ page, you can also use <control>Was this page helpful</control> feedback form on the bottom of each page by providing more details after clicking the <control>No</control> button. Please try to be as specific as possible and provide your e-mail address for further questions and getting notified of updates.

If you just want to share feedback on the guide, again, [raise an issue](https://github.com/JetBrains/resharper-devguide/issues), even if it’s for a discussion, ideas on improvements or suggestions.

> Please don't use the **RSRP** or **RIDER** YouTrack project for plugin requests - it's intended for the products itself, and you'll get a better response using one of the methods below.

## Problems with Code - Support Issues

For problems related to code, rather than the content of the guide, you have several options:

* **[JetBrains Platform Slack](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/slack/)** – The **#resharper-platform** channel is a great place to ask questions, with answers coming from both JetBrains team members and members of the community.
* **[StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com)** – We monitor the [`resharper`](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/resharper), [`resharper-plugins`](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/resharper-plugins) and [`resharper-sdk`](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/resharper-sdk) tags. Make sure to tag the question, or it won't get seen!
* **[Email support](mailto:resharper-plugins@jetbrains.com)** – You can contact us directly, although we would prefer one of the options above, if possible, as the answers are shared with the community.

Of course, all issues will be used to try and improve this guide.

## Problems with Products

If you have a problem with a ReSharper Platform-based product, such as ReSharper or JetBrains Rider, please raise an issue on [YouTrack](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com), assigning it to the correct project for the product.
